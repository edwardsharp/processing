Plaster
molds
are
used
for
several
purposes,
from
the
plaster
casts
of
footmarks
in
detective
branch
technics
to
the
plaster
bandages
used
when
dressing
broken
limbs.
When
stuffing
animals
plaster
casts
of
the
dead
animal
are
often
used
to
get
a
correct
reproduction
of
muscles
and
the
like.This
invention
relates
more
specifically
to
a
method
of
producing
an
essentially
improved
plaster
mold
or
plaster
cast
with
great
advantages
within
several
application
fields.Divisible
plaster
molds
have
been
used
for
a
long
time
when
producing
casts
of
objects
of
art,
such
as
statues
and
the
like.
However,
in
spite
of
all
technical
development
in
the
last
decades
primitive
methods
are
still
used
requiring
a
great
skill.
The
same
applies
to
plaster
cast
bandages
and
dressings
around
injured
or
broken
limbs
of
animals
and
human
beings,
where
methods
used
also
require
a
skill
developed
by
practice
in
order
to
obtain
a
good
result.In
veterinary
surgery,
where
you
are
often
forced
to
secure
a
broken
leg
or
the
like
by
splints,
a
plaster
cast
bandage
is
still
being
used,
which
involves
great
disadvantages,
among
other
things
due
to
the
long
drying
time
required.
Certainly
the
plaster
solidifies
rapidly,
but
the
excess
of
water
is
to
evaporate
and,
meanwhile,
the
bandage
is
relatively
weak
and,
above
all,
has
a
soft
surface.
When
such
a
bandage
is
then
to
be
removed,
it
is
found,
as
a
rule,
that
the
bandage
sticks
to
underlying
hair
tegument
or
the
like
making
it
necessary
to
anesthetize
the
injured
animal
at
removal,
and
that
the
following
irritation
or
smarting
pain
are
extremely
annoying
even
if
infections
do
not
supervene.
The
same
applies
to
a
large
extent
also
to
a
corresponding
supporting
dressing
around
human
limbs
or
the
like.Moreover,
these
traditional
plaster
bandages,
whether
human
beings
or
animals
are
concerned,
must
often
be
broken
up,
for
swelling
or
off-swelling
of
the
treated
part
of
the
body
may
require
a
new
bandage.
An
X-ray
control
also
requires
breaking
up,
as
it
is
not
desired
to
expose
the
patient
to
the
strong
X-ray
doses
necessary
to
penetrate
the
bandage.Stuff

retardantAs
a
parent
I
was
very
troubled
to
learn
that
the
dog
in
DOGZ
"dies"
after
a
mere
3
weeks.
This
totally
put
me
off
of
this
game.
We
borrowed
the
game
from
a
friend
to
give
it
a
try
and
although
the
game
itself
was
fun
for
my
kids,
having
them
train
the
dog
and
have
it
"die"
on
them
was
just
disturbing
and
plain
sad.
So
after
trying
out
DOGZ
and
being
rather
disappointed
with
it
we
went
out
and
purchased
POCKET
DOGS
instead.
The
gameplay
and
graphics
there
is
closer
to
Nintendogs
for
Nintendo
DS
and
my
kids
love
it.
Plus
it
has
the
added
benefit
of
being
able
to
keep
the
dog
without
a
set
time
limit.My
advice
is
to
borrow
or
rent
(if
you
can)
"Dogz"
but
if
you
want
a
keeper
then
go
for
"Pocket
Dogs."I
would
not
recommend
this
game
for
very
young
children
or
kids
with
a
sensitive
heart
unless
you
prepare
them
before
they
start
the
game.
Our
seven
year
old
daughter
was
crushed
when
her
dog
"went
away".
After
many
tears
and
a
web
search
I
learned
about
the
forever
mode
but
unfortunately
she
had
not
saved
the
game
so
she
couldn't
go
back
and
play
with
her
puppy
friend.
I
was
able
to
recreate
the
same
kind
of
dog
with
the
same
name
and
she
was
off
and
happy
again,
but
this
came
after
a
very
sad
little
girl.
Make
sure
your
child
knows
they
get
to
play
with
their
puppy
for
three
weeks
and
then
can
change
dogs
or
can
save
their
game
to
play
in
forever
mode.I
will
probably
end
up
selling
this
game
because
I
think
it
is
terrible
for
small
kids.
My
[...]
son
played
it
all
day
and
"raised"
his
puppy.
The
dog
ended
up
dying!!!!
It
doesn't
mention
that
anywhere
in
the
instructions
for
the
game.
Think
carefully
before
buying
this
for
a
child.How
would
you
feel
if
you
woke
up
and
your
dogs
was
dead?How
would
